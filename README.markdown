Bad ~~Wolf~~ Canine
===================

A color scheme for Vim, pieced together by [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/).

See the original for more info and options: [Bad Wolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf/)

What is this fork?
------------------

Inspired by [flattened](https://github.com/romainl/flattened), this colorscheme
is visually identical to the original (with `g:badwolf_darkgutter = 1`, and
a *slightly* lighter background for Good Wolf), but simplified under the hood.

Bad Wolf is implemented via functions that create highlighting, allowing users
to easily modify variables to change minor options, and to have an easier
overview of the color palette. This colorscheme is simply the output of those
functions, making the vimscript more like how a typical colorscheme would look.

The only significant difference is that there's no options for canine.

Why?
----

I was bored and I don't need the fancy functions or options.
